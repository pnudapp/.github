Bank of the free &mdash; but actually free (libre) and open source.

## What is this?

This GitHub organisation was created by [Ricardo Balk][gh:@ricardobalk], a Bunq user and front-end engineer passionate about modern web development technologies, creating beautiful user interfaces and writing clean & re-usable code.

The goal of this project is to create community-driven, free (libre) and open source versions of Bunq's apps, so that everyone can use, inspect and contribute to the source code.

The idea to create this came from Ricardo's visits to DeLaMar in Amsterdam for Bunq Update 20 &amp; 21. After having a few conversations about various subjects, like talking about some great ideas for future  functionalities, Ricardo realised it would be great to have this place where developers could share their ideas and work on them together directly here on GitHub, instead of just talking about ideas and/or waiting for Bunq to
implement them.

Ricardo's vision:

> You can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.

Or &mdash; in Dutch:

> Niemand heeft ooit wat gehad aan een afwachtende houding, behalve een koude kont en een stijve nek. Dus, ga ervoor!
