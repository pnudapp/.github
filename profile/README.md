Bank of the free &mdash; but actually free (libre) and open source.

## What is this?

This GitHub organisation was created by [Ricardo Balk][gh:@ricardobalk], a Bunq user and front-end engineer passionate about modern web development technologies, creating beautiful user interfaces and writing clean & re-usable code.

The goal of this project is to create community-driven, free (libre) and open source versions of Bunq's apps, so that everyone can use, inspect and contribute to the source code.
